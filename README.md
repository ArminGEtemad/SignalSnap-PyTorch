# SignalSnap (PyTorch): Signal Analysis In Python Made Easy
by A. Ghorbanietemad, M. Sifft, and D. Hägele

After the initial release of SignalSnap, [here](https://github.com/MarkusSifft/SignalSnap), we have decided to rewrite and optimize it using PyTorch. This new version of SignalSnap aims
to be more user friendly, faster and easier to maintain. The decision to change the backend library from ArrayFire to PyTorch was based of the following factors:
* Apple has been switching to its own GPU designs as part of its transition to Apple Silicon, meaning that MPS backend is now essential.
* PyTorch has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming one of the most widely-used libraries.
* More reliable and no occurance of Heisenbugs (!) leading to an easier debugging process. 
* This active community provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and community-driven support, making it easier for developers to adopt and contribute to SignalSnap.
* Transitioning to PyTorch positions SignalSnap favorably for future development. This ensures long-term compatibility and easier maintenance compared to less mainstream frameworks.

## What are higher order spectra?
Higher-order spectra contain additional information that is not contained within the second order spectrum. SignalSnap is not only capable of calculating the first- and second-order but also
third- and four-order spectrum.
These have the following properties:
* Spectra beyond second order are not sensitive to Gaussian noise.
* Third order spectrum: shows contributions whenever the phase of two frequencies and their sum are phase correlated
* Fourth order spectrum: is to be interpreted as intensity correlation between two frequencies or if more simplified it is correlation of two second order spectra.

SignalSnap uses the definition of higher order spectra introduced by [Brillinger in 1965](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38365655_An_Introduction_to_Polyspectra). 
```math
2\pi\,\delta(\omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_n) \,S^{(n)}_z(\omega_1, \cdots , \omega_{n-1})= C_n\big(z(\omega_1), \cdots, z(\omega_n)\big)
```
The numerical calculation of these spectra is backed by __unbiased estimators for multivariate cumulatns__ introduced by [Fabian Schefczik and Daniel Hägele](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12154),
leading to highly rigorous and reliable results which makes SignalSnap unique. 

In SignalSnap, you can calculate these spectra by first easily make your data into an object and then put them into a list and select them (if necessary) by their index:
```python
config1 = DataImportConfig(data=signal_trace_1)
config2 = DataImportConfig(data=signal_trace_2)
data_config_list = [config1, config2]
selected_data = [0,1]
```
Then you need to give SignalSnap your settings and configuration for further calculation:
```python
sconfig = SpectrumConfig(dt=0.001, f_min=0, f_max=5, s3_calc='1/2',f_unit='MHz',
                         backend='mps', order_in=[1, 2, 3, 4], spectrum_size=500,
                         show_first_frame=True)

# we will come to CrossConfig later!
# But you need this object to tell SignalSnap that you want to calculate auto-correlations.
cconfig = CrossConfig(auto_corr=True) 
```
and in the end, SignalSnap needs your command to execute the calculation!
```python
scalc = SpectrumCalculator(sconfig, cconfig, data_config_list, selected=selected_data)
scalc.calc_spec();
```
and voilà the spectra are now accessible as python dictionaries:
```python
scalc.s # this is the spectrum value
scalc.s_err # this is the error value
scalc.freq # this is the frequency value
```
Of course, SignalSnap has its own built-in plotting functions with extensive configuration as well:
```python
pconfig = PlotConfig(f_min=0, f_max=5, display_orders=[1, 2, 3, 4],
                     significance=3, arcsinh_scale=(False, 0.02),
                     plot_format=['re', 'im'], insignif_transparency=0.5)
plotter = SpectrumPlotter(sconfig, cconfig, scalc, pconfig)
plotter.display()
```
## Why higher-order multi-channel spectra?
Multiple stationary real signals may exhibit correlations. Such correlations can be characterized by cross-correlation spectra. Therefore, we generalized the Brillinger's definition 
of higher order spectra for such correlations:
```math
2\pi\,\delta(\omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_n) \,S^{(n)}_{z_1, \cdots, z_n}(\omega_1, \cdots , \omega_{n-1})= C_n\big(z_1(\omega_1), \cdots, z_n(\omega_n)\big)
```

## Some bechmarking
The optimized new version of SignalSnap is much faster for higher resolutions

## Why is SignalSnap (ArrayFire) still important?

## Support
The development of the SignalSnap package is supported by the working group Spectroscopy of Condensed Matter of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy at the Ruhr University Bochum.

## Dependencies
For the package multiple libraries are used for the numerics and displaying the results:
* NumPy
* SciPy
* MatPlotLib
* tqdm
* Numba
* h5py
* PyTorch
* Pandas
* tabulate
